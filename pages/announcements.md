# Announcements

- 1/14/2020: The PRISMS Center will hold a workshop at the TMS 2020 149th Annual Meeting and Exhibition, where participants will become familiar with PRISMS software tools, including PRISMS-PF, and will gain the knowledge about when to use these tools. For more information and registration [visit this site](https://www.tms.org/TMS2020/Professional_Development/Workshops_and_Courses/PRISMS__Training_Workshop/TMS2020/pd/PRISMS_Workshop.aspx?hkey=7238a67d-383c-4223-880d-8ea3d87f4729&_zs=DiBXC1&_zl=xeeV5).  

- 12/2/2019: The PRISMS Center at the University of Michigan is looking to hire a new research faculty member to lead the development of PRISMS-PF and participate in phase field research related to the centerâ€™s goals. If you are interested in applying, [please visit this page](https://careers.umich.edu/job_detail/180053/research_investigatorasst_research_scientist).

- 6/11/2019: The registration for the 2019 PRISMS Center Workshop is now open. The workshop is August 5-9 in Ann Arbor, MI. The first three days are dedicated to hands-on training with the PRISMS codes (including a day for PRISMS-PF). The final two days are a series of technical presentations by members of the PRISMS Center and distinguished outside guests. You can register [here](http://www.prisms-center.org/#/workshop).

- 6/10/2019: A [new GUI-based nanoHUB tool](https://nanohub.org/tools/prismspfmisfit) has been released that is powered by PRISMS-PF. It calculates the equilibrium shape of a precipitate due to anisotropic interfacial energy and misfit strain.

- 9/11/2018: Please take a moment to fill out the short [2018 PRISMS-PF User Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/rAp8cJAeBjqsi5ep1). The survey results will guide future PRISMS-PF development and help us justify continued funding.

- 8/21/2018: The tentative dates for the 2019 PRISMS Workshop are August 5-9 in Ann Arbor, MI. The first three days are dedicated to hands-on training with the PRISMS codes (including a day for PRISMS-PF).

- 8/21/2018: [Version 2.1 released.](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/releases/tag/v2.1) This is a moderate-level update to v2.0.2. The structure of equations and ICs/BCs files has been updated for improved legibility and flexibility. A new grain-remapper has been introduced to handling polycrystalline simulations with many grains and a new hybrid Newton/Picard nonlinear solver has been added.

- 8/3/2018: The new [online PRISMS-PF user manual](doxygen/manual.html) is released. This replaces the PDF user manual previously used.

- 5/30/2018: [Version 2.0.2 released.](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/releases/tag/v2.0.2) This is a minor update to v2.0.1. The biggest change is that nucleation parameters can now be set on a per-variable basis.

- 11/21/2017: [Version 2.0.1 released.](https://github.com/prisms-center/phaseField/releases/tag/v2.0.1) This is a minor update to v2.0. The biggest change is the introduction of a checkpoint/restart system.
