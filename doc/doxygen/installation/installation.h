/** \page installation Installation

Welcome to the installation guide for PRISMS-PF! This is arguably the most difficult part
for most of our users, but we hope to make it as easy as possible. If you run into any
issues, please feel free to \ref contact us.

There are many ways to install PRISMS-PF, and we will try to cover the most common ones
here.

/** \page docker Installing with Docker
As mentioned in the \ref installation page, Docker is potentially the easiest way to
install PRISMS-PF. However, it is not performant and unsuitable for large simulations.
We'll get into those reasons with a brief introduction to Docker.

\subsection docker_introduction Introduction to Docker
Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications in containers. What are
containers? Containers are typically stripped down versions of virtual machines that allow
you to run an application in an isolated and reproducible environment. This custom
environment is defined by a Dockerfile, which is a text file that contains all the
instructions to build the container image. The image can then be run on any machine that
has Docker installed, regardless of the underlying operating system.

Importantly for PRISMS-PF, Docker allows you to run our software without needing to
install any dependencies. All you have to do is download the Docker image! Depending on
your operating system and the difference (if any) between the your hardware and the
emulated hardware, the running of a Docker image may add some overhead, which will slow
down your simulations. Additionally, with the Docker image, you're stuck with the image we
provide. If you want to change the compiler, the configuration of dependencies, or any
other things, you should consider \ref source instead.

\subsection docker_installation Installation with Docker
To install PRISMS-PF with Docker, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine.
You can find instructions for installing Docker on the official [Docker
website](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/).

are on Windows, we recommend using a virtual machine or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
to run a Linux environment. Please follow the Linux
instructions if you use either of those options.
