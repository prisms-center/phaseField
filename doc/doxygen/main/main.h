\subsection overview Overview
PRISMS-PF is a powerful, massively parallel finite element code for conducting phase field
and other related simulations of microstructural evolution. The phase field method is
commonly used for predicting the evolution of microstructures under a wide range of
environments and materials.

The main goals of PRISMS-PF are to:
- provide a **simple interface** for solving a **wide variety** of partial differential
equations (PDEs)
- have **parallel performance** that meets or exceeds that of other phase field codes
- be **extensible** to allow users to add their own PDEs and modules
- provide a **rich set of pre-built applications** for common phase field problems
- **benchmark** code against other codes to ensure correctness
- be **open source** and **freely available** to the community

\remark While PRISMS-PF was conceived as a phase field code, it is by no means limited to
phase field applications. Like deal.II positions itself as a general-purpose finite
element library, PRISMS-PF is a general-purpose partial differential equation (PDE)
solver.\n\n However, the numerics are primarily designed for phase field, and might be
unsuitable for your application. If you find yourself in this position, please \ref

This code is developed by the PRedictive Integrated Structural Materials Science (PRISMS)
Center at University of Michigan which is supported by the U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE), Office of Basic Energy Sciences, Division of Materials Sciences and Engineering
under Award #DE-SC0008637.
