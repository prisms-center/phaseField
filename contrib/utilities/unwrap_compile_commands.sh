# This script unwraps the compile_commands.json for the mpicxx compiler wrapper.
# The compile wrapper can cause issues with clang-tidy as described here:
# https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2328
#
# Instead of using the mpicxx wrapper, we use the actual compiler (e.g., g++) and
# all passed arguments as you see with mpicxx -show. For now this script is only
# enable when a specific CMake flag is passed (i.e., UNWRAP_COMPILER=ON).
#
#
# Usage:
# ./contrib/utilities/unwrap_compile_commands.sh
