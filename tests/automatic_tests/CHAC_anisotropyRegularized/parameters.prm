# of the boundaries have the same boundary condition, only one boundary condition
# type needs to be given. If multiple boundary condition types are needed, give a
# comma-separated list of the types. The order is the miniumum of x, maximum of x,
# minimum of y, maximum of y, minimum of z, maximum of z (i.e left, right, bottom,
# top in 2D and left, right, bottom, top, front, back in 3D). The value of a
# Dirichlet BC is specfied in the following way -- DIRCHILET: val -- where 'val' is
# the desired value. If the boundary condition is NON_UNIFORM_DIRICHLET, the
# boundary condition should be specified in the appropriate function in 'ICs_and_BCs.h'.
# Example 1: All periodic BCs for variable 'c'
