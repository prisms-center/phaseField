# Set the boundary conditions
# =================================================================================
# Set the boundary condition for each variable, where each variable is given by
# its name, as defined in equations.h. The four boundary condition
# types are NATURAL, DIRICHLET, NON_UNIFORM_DIRICHLET and PERIODIC. If all
# of the boundaries have the same boundary condition, only one boundary condition
# type needs to be given. If multiple boundary condition types are needed, give a
# comma-separated list of the types. The order is the miniumum of x, maximum of x,
# minimum of y, maximum of y, minimum of z, maximum of z (i.e left, right, bottom,
# top in 2D and left, right, bottom, top, front, back in 3D). The value of a
# Dirichlet BC is specfied in the following way -- DIRCHILET: val -- where 'val' is
# the desired value. If the boundary condition is NON_UNIFORM_DIRICHLET, the
# boundary condition should be specified in the appropriate function in 'ICs_and_BCs.h'.
# Example 1: All periodic BCs for variable 'c'
# set Boundary condition for variable c = PERIODIC
# Example 2: Zero-derivative BCs on the left and right, Dirichlet BCs with value
# 1.5 on the top and bottom for variable 'n' in 2D
# set Boundary condition for variable n = NATURAL, NATURAL, DIRICHLET: 1.5, DIRICHLET: 1.5

# Set the user-defined model constants, which must have a counter-part given in
# customPDE.h. These are most often used in the residual equations in equations.h,
# but may also be used for initial conditions and nucleation calculations. The type
# options currently are DOUBLE, INT, BOOL, TENSOR, and [symmetry] ELASTIC CONSTANTS
# where [symmetry] is ISOTROPIC, TRANSVERSE, ORTHOTROPIC, or ANISOTROPIC.
